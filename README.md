# osagg: OpenSearch aggregation pushdown for Apache Superset

`osagg` lets Superset treat an OpenSearch index (or alias, or pattern) as a normal
**physical dataset** while every `GROUP BY` / aggregate runs **inside OpenSearch**.
Superset keeps generating plain SQL; osagg compiles it to OpenSearch composite
aggregations (paged), and only the small aggregated result is post-processed
by an embedded, locked-down DuckDB (ordering, limits, ratios, HAVING, window
functions, joins, …).

```

                                    └─ raw rows     → search + sort + size; beyond a page PIT + search_after (or scroll)
   ▲                                      │
   └──── DuckDB (in-memory, no file / network / extension access) runs the rest
```

It is packaged as a normal Python wheel with:

* a DB-API 2.0 driver (`osagg.connect`)
* a SQLAlchemy 1.4/2.0 dialect (`osagg://`)
* a Superset DB engine spec (time grains, date literals, series-limit strategy),
  registered through the `superset.db_engine_specs` entry point

Tested with Superset 6.1 (running lab: charts, dashboards, SQL Lab, drill-to-detail,
alerts), and with the Superset 6.0.0 and 5.0.0 packages (engine spec loaded by
Superset's own loader, columns and queries through Superset's `Database` model, full
test suite under their pinned sqlglot 27/26 and pyarrow 16/14). Python 3.11,
OpenSearch 3.8, Trino 483.

## Install (pip only)

Full, tested runbook (OpenSearch role, pip online / offline wheelhouse, verification,
troubleshooting): [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md).

```bash
PY=$(head -1 "$(command -v superset)" | cut -c3-)          # the Python that runs Superset
$PY -m pip install --upgrade osagg-0.2.11-py3-none-any.whl  # deps: duckdb, opensearch-py, Events
# offline: $PY -m pip install --upgrade --no-index --find-links ./wheelhouse osagg
$PY -m pip install trino                                     # only for transport=trino
```

Nothing to add to `superset_config.py`: the wheel registers the engine and its SQL
dialect (DuckDB grammar) through Superset's entry points. Restart the web server and
the Celery workers, then **Settings → Database connections → + Database →
OpenSearch (aggregation pushdown)**.

## Connection URI

Direct (Superset workers call the OpenSearch REST API):

```
osagg://USER:PASSWORD@opensearch-host:9200/default?timezone=Europe/Paris
osagg+https://USER:PASSWORD@opensearch-host:9200/default?timezone=Europe/Paris&ca_certs=/etc/ssl/os-ca.pem
```

Through Trino (Trino stays the only gateway; each OpenSearch request is sent
with `opensearch.system.raw_query`, composite pages included):

```
osagg://TRINO_USER@trino-host:8080/default?transport=trino&trino_catalog=opensearch&timezone=Europe/Paris
osagg://TRINO_USER:PWD@trino-host:8443/default?transport=trino&trino_http_scheme=https&timezone=Europe/Paris
```

| parameter | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `timezone` | `UTC` | wall-clock zone of all TIMESTAMP values (filters, buckets, results) |
| `max_scan_rows` | `500000` | cap for reads without a LIMIT (aggregations that cannot be pushed down, SELECT without LIMIT) |
| `max_rows` | `0` | optional cap for `SELECT … LIMIT n` (default: none, rows are read page by page) |
| `max_buckets_total` | `2000000` | cap on groups returned by one aggregation |
| `page_size` | `50000` | composite page size (also bounded by the cluster `search.max_buckets`) |
| `topn` | `exact` | `approx`: `ORDER BY <aggregate> LIMIT n` on one key uses a two-phase terms aggregation (exact values, approximate membership at the boundary) |
| `count_distinct` | `exact` | `approx`: `COUNT(DISTINCT)` returns the cardinality estimate above `cardinality_precision` (the former behaviour) |
| `cardinality_precision` | `3000` | `precision_threshold` of the cardinality sketch: below it the count is exact; at it, `count_distinct=exact` counts the values as keys |
| `percentile_compression` | `500` | TDigest compression for MEDIAN / PERCENTILE_CONT (≈0.3 % max error) |
| `date_probe` | `true` | `false`: date fields in the default format are not checked for calendar days (values all at 00:00 UTC) |
| `request_timeout` | `300` | seconds per OpenSearch request |
| `join_max_keys` | `100000` | joins: an index that no other index filters may have at most this many matching documents or distinct join keys (see Joins of indices) |
| `label_source`, `label_date_format`, `label_time_source` | `POSITION_DATE`, `%Y%m%d`, `@timestamp_date` | where the business-date labels come from, per index (see Business-date labels) |
| `tables` | – | indices / aliases / patterns to show as tables, e.g. `tables=batch-jobs-*` (required for least-privilege accounts, see docs/DEPLOY.md) |
| `scheme`, `verify_certs`, `ca_certs`, `client_cert`, `client_key`, `url_prefix` | – | TLS / proxy options (direct) |
| `transport`, `trino_catalog`, `trino_schema`, `trino_user`, `trino_password`, `trino_http_scheme`, `max_buckets` | – | Trino transport |

## What is pushed down

| SQL | OpenSearch |
|---|---|
| `=`, `<>`, `IN`, `NOT IN`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `BETWEEN`, `IS [NOT] NULL`, `IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM` | term / terms / range / exists, with `exists` guards so negations keep SQL NULL semantics |
| `LIKE`, `ILIKE`, `NOT LIKE`, `starts_with` | prefix / wildcard (`case_insensitive`) |
| `AND` / `OR` / `NOT`, constant sub-expressions (`now() - INTERVAL '1 hour'`) | bool query, constants folded |
| `LOWER(col) = 'x'`, `CAST(ts AS DATE) = DATE '…'` | case-insensitive term, day range in the time zone |
| `GROUP BY col` | composite `terms` (`missing_bucket` → NULL group) |
| `DATE_TRUNC('second'…'year', ts)`, `TIME_BUCKET(INTERVAL 'n minutes/hours', ts)`, `CAST(ts AS DATE)` | `date_histogram` with `time_zone` |
| `FLOOR(x / n) * n` | `histogram` |
| `COUNT(*)`, `COUNT(col)`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` (numeric, date, boolean, keyword) | doc_count, value_count, sum, min, max, terms(size 1) |
| `COUNT(DISTINCT col)` | cardinality while it is exact (below `cardinality_precision`); at it, the values become keys of the buckets and DuckDB counts them (exact) |
| `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` | cardinality (an estimate above `cardinality_precision`) |
| `MEDIAN`, `QUANTILE_CONT`, `PERCENTILE_CONT … WITHIN GROUP` | percentiles (TDigest: an estimate, ≈0.3 % with the default compression) |
| `STDDEV_SAMP/POP`, `VAR_SAMP/POP` | extended_stats |
| `SUM(CASE WHEN c THEN x ELSE 0 END)`, `agg(x) FILTER (WHERE c)`, `COUNT_IF(c)` | `filter` sub-aggregation |
| any other GROUP BY / WHERE expression over grouped columns (`CASE … 'Others'`, `UPPER`, `COALESCE`, `EXTRACT(hour …)`, `strftime`, Sunday weeks) | **two-level**: OpenSearch groups by the underlying columns (timestamps at the needed grain), DuckDB re-aggregates the buckets (sum / count / min / max / avg) |
| `ORDER BY key LIMIT n` / `LIMIT n` | composite stops after n buckets |
| `SELECT … WHERE … ORDER BY col LIMIT n OFFSET m` | search with sort / size; beyond 10 000 rows, point-in-time + `search_after` (a scroll on clusters that do not sort on `_shard_doc`, e.g. OpenSearch 2.x) |
| virtual datasets `SELECT … FROM (SELECT * FROM idx WHERE …) AS virtual_table` | flattened into one pushed-down query |
| `JOIN` / `LEFT JOIN` / `USING` of two or more indices on equal fields, in aggregating queries | each index grouped by its join keys and GROUP BY columns in OpenSearch, keys of the smaller indices pushed to the bigger ones as `terms`; DuckDB joins the grouped rows (see Joins of indices) |

| any other filter on **one** keyword column (CASE mappings, `LOWER`/`SUBSTRING`, `POSITION_LABEL LIKE 'W-%'`, Python functions) | the column's distinct values are listed (one small aggregation), the filter is evaluated on them, and `terms` on that column is pushed down |
| `ORDER BY <column>` / `ORDER BY <position>` / arithmetic expressions on raw rows | sort / painless script sort, pushed down with LIMIT |

Everything else (ORDER BY, LIMIT, HAVING, arithmetic on aggregates, window
functions, CTEs, UNION, the join of grouped rows) runs in DuckDB on the aggregated
rows.

If a query cannot be pushed down (e.g. a non-decomposable aggregate over an
arbitrary expression), osagg fetches the needed columns of the matching
documents **only if** there are at most `max_scan_rows` of them; otherwise it
fails with a message explaining why, instead of pulling billions of rows.

## Business-date labels (POSITION_LABEL)

Indices with a keyword `POSITION_DATE` (yyyymmdd) get a computed column
`POSITION_LABEL`: `D` (today's position date only), `D-x`, `W-x`, `Y-x` relative to the session date, and
`D+x` for a position date x days after today (weekends →
Friday, weekdays before 14:00 → previous business day). Filters on it are rewritten to
`POSITION_DATE`: `=` / `IN` become a `terms` filter on the dates computed from the
calendar (no extra request), other predicates go through the single-column value
enumeration, and `GROUP BY` groups on the date in OpenSearch. URI parameters:
`label_timezone` (default: the host clock), `label_cutoff` (`14:00`), `label_years`
(`true`), `label_source` / `label_column` (`POSITION_DATE` / `POSITION_LABEL`,
`label_source=none` turns it off). See docs/DEPLOY.md, step 5b.

The position date may have another name or form per index: `label_source` is a
comma-separated list tried in order, `pattern:FIELD` items applying only to the indices
matching the pattern, `FIELD=format` giving the format of a keyword date. Date fields
work too. For example `risk-*:COB_DATE=%Y-%m-%d,POS_DAY,POSITION_DATE`: `risk-*`
indices use their keyword `COB_DATE` (yyyy-mm-dd), the others a date field `POS_DAY`
or the keyword `POSITION_DATE`. `label_time_source` picks the execution time the same
way. Indices without any of these fields simply have no label columns.

`POSITION_TIME` is the execution time (`@timestamp_date`) moved onto the D-1 position
date (+7 days for W-1, +14 for W-2…): use it as the X-axis with `POSITION_LABEL` as
dimension to overlay position dates on one timeline. Time buckets on it group by
position date and minute in OpenSearch; time ranges on it become one `@timestamp_date`
range per position date.

Other Python functions can be exposed to osagg SQL with
`osagg.register_function(name, func, ["VARCHAR"], "VARCHAR")`; they run in DuckDB on
grouped values, and single-column filters built on them are pushed down as terms.

## Joins of indices

OpenSearch cannot join, but an aggregating query over joined indices still runs
without reading documents:

```sql
SELECT c."SITE", b."TIER", COUNT(*), SUM(a."JOB_DURATION_d")
FROM "batch-jobs" a
JOIN "apps" b ON a."APPLICATION" = b."APPLICATION" AND a."ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" = b."ENVIRONMENT_TYPE"
LEFT JOIN "teams" c ON b."TEAM" = c."TEAM"
WHERE a."STATUS_INFO" = 'FAILED' AND a."POSITION_LABEL" = 'D-1'
GROUP BY 1, 2
```

* Each index is aggregated in OpenSearch with its own filters, by its join keys and its
  own GROUP BY columns; every group keeps its document count. DuckDB joins the grouped
  rows and combines COUNT / SUM / AVG / MIN / MAX exactly (a group counts as many times
  as it matches on the other side).
* Huge indices: the indices are aggregated smallest first (documents matching their
  filters), and the join keys found so far are pushed to the next ones as a `terms`
  filter. Two billion-document indices joined on a job id, with a filter keeping 5,000
  jobs on one side, are both grouped for those 5,000 ids only. Keys are never pushed
  into the preserved side of a LEFT JOIN.
* Every index must be bounded: at most `join_max_keys` (100,000) matching documents,
  or keys received from an index aggregated before it, or at most `join_max_keys`
  distinct join keys (cardinality aggregation, on a sample first). Otherwise the query
  is refused before anything is read, with the reason.
* Refused, never answered by reading documents: row lists over a join (no aggregate),
  `COUNT(DISTINCT …)` or percentiles across the join, conditions mixing indices
  (`a.x > b.y`), join conditions other than equalities, `FULL` / `CROSS` joins, join
  fields of different types.
* In Superset: SQL Lab, or a virtual dataset that lists its columns
  (`SELECT a."APPLICATION", a."JOB_DURATION_d", b."TEAM" FROM … JOIN …`); charts on
  it aggregate through the join. `EXPLAIN` shows the order of the indices, each
  request and the keys each index receives.

## AI agent and tools (Superset 6.1 MCP)

`tools/` holds an AI agent for Superset 6.1's MCP service with a local OpenAI-compatible
LLM, and a second MCP service for what Superset's lacks (docs/DEPLOY.md, sections 10-11):

* `superset_agent.py` — asks the data dictionary first, runs SQL through osagg, answers
  report requests in the chat (summary, table, text chart) and gives JSON, an Excel file,
  a chart image or an e-mail when asked; it validates chart configs before Superset's MCP
  service sees them (no duplicate or broken charts).
* `superset_tools_mcp.py` — `describe_data` (field meanings, synonyms, values,
  relationships, glossary from `catalog.yaml`), `export_excel` (row lists may join a big
  index with small ones here only), `chart_image`, `send_email`, `create_report`.

Everything installs from one offline bundle (`scripts/make_bundle.sh`, `deploy/bundle/`).

## EXPLAIN

In SQL Lab: `EXPLAIN SELECT …` shows, in a few rows, the version of osagg, how each field
the query names is read (per group of indices when they map it differently), every
OpenSearch request (one row each, compact JSON: open the cell or copy it) and the residual
DuckDB SQL; `EXPLAIN VERBOSE` writes the requests indented, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT …` also
runs it and reports rows, requests and OpenSearch time per scan. Time bounds are ISO
instants with their offset (`"gte": "2026-09-30T21:00:58.251+02:00"`), as you would write
them yourself.

## Semantics worth knowing

* Results are exact, with these exceptions: percentiles (MEDIAN, QUANTILE_CONT,
  PERCENTILE_CONT are TDigest estimates), `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT`, and
  `count_distinct=approx` / `topn=approx` when you ask for them.
* An OpenSearch answer from part of the shards (a failed or timed-out shard) is
  an error, never a result: OpenSearch itself answers HTTP 200 with what the
  other shards hold.
* Timestamps are naive wall-clock values in `timezone`. In zones with DST,
  sub-day buckets of the repeated autumn hour are merged, like SQL on local time.
* Date fields whose format has no time of day (`yyyyMMdd`, `basic_date`, …) and
  default-format date fields holding only midnights are calendar days in UTC,
  whatever `timezone`; `= 20261001` is read in the field's own format.
* A field the indices of a pattern map differently (text with `.keyword` here,
  keyword there; date here, keyword there) is compared in each group of indices
  as that group maps it, as Discover's filters do.
* Multi-valued fields: grouping counts a document once per value (OpenSearch
  terms semantics, like `UNNEST`); `col = 'x'` matches if any value matches;
  `COUNT(col)` of a keyword or number counts its values and `SUM` adds them all. Raw rows return
  multi-valued keyword fields as JSON text and the first value of a number.
* `text` fields are grouped / compared exactly through their keyword sub-field
  (`field.keyword`); text fields without one cannot be grouped. Values longer
  than the keyword's `ignore_above` (256 in the dynamic mapping) are not in it:
  where a field has some, they are read from the documents.
* `nested` fields are not exposed.
* Through Trino, raw-document queries are limited to 10 000 rows per query
  (no point-in-time through `raw_query`); aggregations have no such limit.

## Development

```bash
pip install -e .[test,trino]
pytest tests/                                 # offline: no OpenSearch needed
```

The offline tests check the generated OpenSearch requests (including SQL captured from
Superset 6.1 charts, which must be pushed down completely), the business-date labels
against a reference implementation, paging, retries and TLS options. The integration
tests (every query through a real OpenSearch compared with DuckDB over the same documents,
both transports, forced paging) run on an internal lab and are not published.
